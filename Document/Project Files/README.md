# TRAFFICTELLIGENCE_PROJECT
Traffictelligence: Advanced Traffic Volume Estimation with Machine Learning

# Scenario 1: Dynamic Traffic Management
TrafficTelligence enables dynamic traffic management by providing real-time traffic volume estimations. Transportation authorities can use this information to implement adaptive traffic control systems, adjust signal timings, and optimize lane configurations to reduce congestion and improve traffic flow.

# Scenario 2: Urban Development Planning
City planners and urban developers can leverage TrafficTelligence predictions to plan new infrastructure projects effectively. By understanding future traffic volumes, they can design road networks, public transit systems, and commercial zones that are optimized for traffic efficiency and accessibility.

# Scenario 3: Commuter Guidance and Navigation
Individual commuters and navigation apps can benefit from TrafficTelligence's accurate traffic volume estimations. Commuters can plan their routes intelligently, avoiding congested areas and selecting optimal travel times based on predicted traffic conditions. Navigation apps can provide real-time updates and alternative routes to improve overall travel experiences.

# Data Visualization
Data visualization is where a given data set is presented in a graphical format. It helps the detection of patterns, trends and correlations that might go undetected in text-based data.

# HeatMap
Correlation strength varies based on colour, lighter the colour between two variables, more the strength between the variables, darker the colour displays the weaker correlation

# PairPlot
A pair plot is used to understand the best set of features to explain a relationship between two variables or to form the most separated clusters. It also helps to form some simple classification models by drawing some simple lines or making a linear separation in our data-set.

# Boxplot
Box plots are useful as they show the average score of a data set. The median is the average value from a set of data and is shown by the line that divides the box into two parts. Half the scores are greater than or equal to this value and half are less.
